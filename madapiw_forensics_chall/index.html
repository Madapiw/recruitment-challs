        <p>
            The capybara or greater capybara <i>(Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris)</i> is a giant cavy rodent native to South
            America. It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant
            member
            is the lesser capybara <i>(Hydrochoerus isthmius)</i>. <br><br> Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and
            it
            is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and
            dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as
            large <br><br>
            as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat
            and
            hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin. It is not considered a threatened species.

        <p>
            The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its
            body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy
            portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair
            differs little from over hair. <br><br>
            
            Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at
            the withers, and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of
            48.9 kg (108 lb). Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are 91 kg
            (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay. Also, an 81
            kg individual was reported in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002.<br><br> Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial
            tails. Their hind legs are slightly longer than
            their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet. Their muzzles
            are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.
            Its karyotype has 2n = 66 and FN = 102, meaning it has 66 chromosomes with a total of 102 arms.

        <p>
            Though quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can
            remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras
            can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in
            water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in
            mud. They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.
